  Amr corp.'s  American Airlines unit  said  it  has called for  federal mediation in   its  contract talks with  unions representing   its  pilots  and  flight attendants    .  
 
 
  A spokesman for  the company  said  American  officials "felt  talks  had reached a point where  mediation  would be helpful."  
  Negotiations with  the pilots  have been going on for 11 months; talks with  flight attendants  began six months ago.  
 
 
   The president of  the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents   American 's more than 10,000 flight attendants ,   called  the request for  mediation   "premature" and characterized  it  as a bargaining tactic that could lead to a lockout.  
   Patt gibbs,  president of  the association  ,  said  talks with  the company   seemed to be progressing well and  the call for  mediation   came as a surprise.  
 
 
   The major outstanding issue in  the negotiations with  the flight attendants    is  a two-tier wage scale , in which recent employees' salaries increase on a different scale than the salaries of employees who have worked at  american  for a longer time.  
   The union  wants to narrow the differences between the new scale and the old one.  
 
 
   The company  declined to comment on  the negotiations  or the outstanding issues.  
  Representatives for the 5,400-member Allied Pilots Association didn't return phone calls.  
 
 
  Under the Federal Railway Labor Act, if the mediator fails to bring  the two sides  together and  the two sides  don't agree to binding arbitration,  a 30-day cooling-off period  follows.  
  After  that ,  the union  can strike or  the company  can lock  the union  out.  
 
 
   Ms. Gibbs  said that in response to  the company 's move,   her  union  will be "escalating"  its  "corporate campaign" against  American  over the next couple of months.  
  In  a corporate campaign ,  a union  tries to get  a company 's financiers, investors, directors and other financial partners to pressure  the company  to meet  union  demands.  
 
 
   A corporate campaign ,  she  said, appeals to   her  members  because " it  is a nice, clean way to take a job action, and  our women  are hired to be nice."  the union  has decided not to strike,  she  said.  
 
 
   The union  has hired a number of professional consultants in  its  battle with  the company , including  Ray Rogers of Corporate Campaign Inc.,  the New York labor consultant who developed the strategy at  Geo. A. Hormel & Co. 's Austin, Minn., meatpacking plant last year  .  
  That campaign, which included a strike, faltered when  the company  hired new workers and the International Meatpacking Union wrested control of the local union from  Rogers ' supporters.
