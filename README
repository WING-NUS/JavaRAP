		Installation Guide


1. Install Charniak's parser (version parser05Aug16).

$ make parseIt

If you encounter the following error message, you may want to try
overwriting the files in the PARSE/ subdirectory of the parser with
those provided in the parser05Aug16.patch.zip zipfile.

[wing.nus@cte PARSE]$ make
/usr/bin/g++  -c -O BchartSm.C
BchartSm.C:30: error: expected initializer before ‘*’ token
BchartSm.C: In member function ‘float Bchart::computepTgT(int, int)’:
BchartSm.C:612: error: ‘globalGi’ was not declared in this scope
make: *** [BchartSm.o] Error 1

2. Get the latest JavaRAP

(http://aye.comp.nus.edu.sg/~qiu/NLPTools/JavaRAP.html), decompress
it, and modify env.jrap *carefully*. It's important that you add "./"
as a directory prefix even it seems unnecessary.

3. Try:

$ java -jar AnaphoraResolution.jar testdata/SimpleTest.txt
